    <p1>Commonly referred to as Highway 420, is a <a href="#">400-series highway</a> in the Canadian province of Ontario
        that connects
        the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) with downtown Niagara Falls. It continues east as a limited-access expressway
        named Niagara Regional Road 420 to connect with the Rainbow Bridge international crossing between Canada and the
        United States over the Niagara River; this was part of Highway 420 until 1998. West of the QEW, the freeway ends
        at an at-grade intersection with Montrose Road <a href="#">(Niagara Regional Road 98).</a> The highway has a
        speed limit of 80
        kilometres per hour (50 mph), making it the only 400-series highway to have a speed limit less than 100
        kilometres per hour (62 mph) for its entirety.</p1>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p2>Originally constructed as a divided four-lane road with two roundabouts, the route of Highway 420 formed part of
        the QEW between 1941 and 1972 before being assigned a unique route number. This took place during the
        reconstruction of the four-lane divided highway into a freeway and the construction of the large interchange at
        the freeway's western terminus. In 1998, the section of Highway 420 east of <a href="#">tanley Avenue</a> was
        transferred to
        the responsibility of the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Regional Road 420.</p2>

    <p1>At 3.3 km (2.1 mi), Highway 420 is the shortest 400-series highway, travelling through Niagara Falls from
        Montrose Road to Stanley Avenue,[1] on the outskirts of the city's tourist district.[2] East of Stanley Avenue
        (Regional Road 102) the highway becomes Niagara Regional Road 420 and is known as Falls Avenue and Newman Hill
        on approach to the Rainbow Bridge. This portion was designated a part of Highway 420 until 2000, when it was
        transferred to the City of <a href="#"> Falls</a> and the Regional Municipality of Niagara, although the
        Ministry of
        Transportation of Ontario (MTO) still assists with the maintenance of it under a Connecting Link agreement.[3]
        East of Drummond Road,[4] Highway 420 features stylized light fixtures with the letters "ER", which stand for
        Elizabeth Regina and are a tribute to <a href="#">The Queen Mother.[5]</a></p1>
    <br>
    <br>

    <p2>420 begins in the west at a signalized intersection with Montrose Road (Regional Road 98),[6] beyond
        which it continues as <a href="#">Watson Street</a> through the residential neighbourhood of Greens Corners to
        Beaverdams Road
        (Regional Road 53).[2] East of Montrose Road, the highway is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved
        median, and passes north of a forest as it approaches an interchange with the QEW. As well as a partial
        cloverleaf interchange that provides almost all directional movements, this <a href="#">four-level stack</a>
        interchange
        features two flyovers that arc from south to east as well as a four lane mainline that curves from north to
        east, directing most westbound Highway 420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.[6]</p2>
    <br>
    <br>


    <p1>East of the QEW, Highway 420 encounters an interchange with Dorchester Road as both cross the Queenston-Chippawa
        Power Canal.[7] This interchange was originally a traffic circle that was removed in the early 1970s.[8] The
        numerous lanes from the stack interchange to the west begin to converge between residential subdivisions east of
        Dorchester Road, gradually narrowing to four through lanes at the <a href="#">Drummond Road interchange.[7]</a>
        After passing
        beneath Portage Road, the route widens on approach to an at-grade intersection with Stanley Avenue. This
        intersection is the eastern end of both the freeway segment of the route and the signed King's Highway 420; east
        of Stanley Avenue the route is signed as Niagara Regional Road 420 and known as Falls Avenue.[9][10]</p1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p2>Now separated by a landscaped median, the route progresses eastward, intersecting MacDonald Avenue and providing
        access to several residential and retail properties that adjoin the road. The route travels within a concrete
        trench and abruptly curves to the southeast as it passes beneath <a href="#">Victoria Avenue,</a> with which
        there is a simple
        interchange.[7] East of this point, the road was named Newman Hill until March 2012. Palmer Avenue and Ontario
        Avenue pass over the route as it descends a hill towards the Niagara Gorge. At the bottom, the route curves to
        the southwest, where it provides access to the <a href="#">Rainbow Bridge</a>border crossing into the United
        States as well as
        the tourist district of the city.[9]</p2>

    <p3>Due to its association with the number 420 in cannabis culture, Highway 420 is also the location for the
        annual Cannabis Conference and Protest, usually taking place sometime around April 20. The event includes a
        march
        beginning near Niagara Falls and travelling to Highway 420.[11][12]</p3>
